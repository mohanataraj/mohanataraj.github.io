Mohan Nataraj, a pure mathematician, theoretical computer scientist and software developer with _**5 years**_ of experience from **_silicon valley of India_** [_Bangalore, India_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore). I’m currently working in an early stage startup - designing and developing. I do lead myself with great confidence and believe in the following,
<em> <strong>
~~~
 "It is by his activities and not by enjoyment that man feels he is alive.
 In idleness we not only feel that life is fleeting, but we also feel lifeless” 
                                                                     -Immanuel kant
~~~
</strong> </em>
Philosophy through experience has always been my innate belief. While it is aberrant for a pure mathematician to say _`"I believe in GOD"`_  my experiences in life would otherwise prove so. 

My research interests include distribution in prime numbers, optimization, mathematical modeling, analysis and any programmable matter.

Two of my most fervent personal research project; I persevere on are _Riemann hypothesis_ and _computer aided drug development_ for [CANCER](./project/cancer-research-and-drug-development/).
