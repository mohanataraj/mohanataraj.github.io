Ideas \u0026amp; Goals : Three most important aspects are ideation, articulation and development.\n1.1 Ideation: (focus, articulation, clarity \u0026amp; user feedback)\n Idea :  Problem statement: a simple service that users desire\u0026hellip; ??  Problem One: to keep track of calories intake and calories burnt during exercise/day. Problem Two: to manage their food intake such as food journal and exercise journal.(replace the word journal with something else) Problem Three: to find healthy food options. Problem Four: to find trainer / training \u0026amp; food plan for better well being. Problem Five: emotional / mind wellness. Problem Six: Social wellness - events/community exploration.     Expand and explore : like all ideas we have alot of options, we then look at those ideas and\u0026hellip; Refine and edit : here we look at those that are necessary or relevant.  The above two points repeated over and over again leads to a process. **: means tentaive idea and may pivot.\n Q) What makes a great user experience for you ?  easy to use. (such as signup, signin and sharing results)  very little time needed to learn or very intuitive app design required. clear icons interface design   minimalistic approach, such as keeping the navigation to just 4 pages etc\u0026hellip;  smooth navigation or no unnecessary step required.   keep track of everything necessary for smoother transition from initial start to making it an habit [very important] clean design and consistent design (colors) classified or grouped acccordingly. not too much notification (leads to user disengagment) more of image based app  landing page is news feeds less text content   app should be fun to use.    MYFITNESS PAL : ability to set goals, target and track progress in weight or percentage. comphrensive : input food, exercis, drinks etc features workout and nothing screams at you.   NOTE: Three major points for great UX :  minimalistic approach - to get to the purpose/goal almost instantly. (usually within 3/4 - clicks) easy to use - such as navigation, icons, interface design (classified food \u0026amp; exercise correctly) fun to use - more image/video based, less text, enjoyable contents (quality of content rather than quantity? depends on what drives revenue.)    2. User Research Research \u0026amp; Development Q) WHAT DOES THE APP DO? This app has three major categories:\n  Food\n keep track of food/calorie intake to reach your goal store food recipes of users. share user recipes with your community or squad. suggest better recipes, fruits, veggies\u0026hellip; by keeping track of my taste via recipe or exercise goal or metal wellness. discover chefs - [GORBOX] **    Fitness\n keeps track of calories burnt/expenditured. maintain exercise journal (call this something else) share your progress/exercise with squad/community/social media find trainers/nutrionist are also users.  personal training diet plan/maintaince (basically nutrionist/trainer can take care of their diet) exercise plan (allow trainers/pro to create a plan for their goals)      Emotional/Inner Wellness\n suggest events or activities for the user based on their fitness goal and metal well being listening to podcast live yoga, meditation **     Q) HOW DOES IT WORK? -  How does it achieve the goal? Do research into content from competitor and see how we can do it differently Goal : is to help people keep track of their fitness level and shift to healthier eating habits so as they have better quality of life i.e; healthier life.  We use following tentative ways :-  Food  store and share recipes calculate food nutritional value suggest different food based on user taste. - suggest food replacement based on caloric values. (more delicious food)      NOTE: suggestion of food based on different criteria has 3 options they are as follows:  RECIPE: videos (youtube, IGTV) blog (inhouse, also see other partner) people who sell food via \u0026ldquo;GORBOX\u0026rdquo; (which should have indemand \u0026amp; subscription homefood)        FITNESS (Exercise)  store and share exercises. share daily achievements. calculate energy expenditured. suggest different exercise based on the current energy and target. suggest trainers based on fitness goal(- they also can manage food goals of client)    Emotional or Social Well-Being:  users or group can create \u0026amp; share events. podcasts on emotional well-being.(keep user entertained) community or group based engagment in activities.(food or fitness or yoga or infact something fun partner with brands related events)    FITNESS AND FOOD experts: - - suggest nutrionalist \u0026amp; trainers for food \u0026amp; fitness to achieve their target. - - check last point of fitness ** confusion need to check to include in Minimal viable product.   Q) WHO BENEFITS FROM IT? The clients, why are we creating this app ? for fun (need better UI/UX app), social good (improve people well-being), money (help single homemakers earn money [GORBOX])\n Users stay fit and track their calories Gym trainers, clients and fitness models Chefs/ Homemakers interested to earn money (FIT CHEFS [GORBOX])   Analyze if the last point is needed in MVP - minimal viable product    Q) WHY WOULD SOMEONE USE THIS?

Problem Statement In this project we build mathematical model or models to optimize (maximize) the expected profit for the next year by optimizing the delivery and stock inventory of the products between the factory, warehouse and shops, given logistics of sales for the year 2015. We further formalize the model by answering the questions in section [3] \n2. Overview  In this section we give the important points required in understanding and solving (formalizing) the problem.\n2.1. The Product In this industry we have two types of products are sold. - Product 1 : Air conditioner = Pr1 - Product 2 : Heater = Pr 2 Comments: - Sales do not occur the same time. (i.e. the sales of P1 and P2 are seasonal - P2 can be assumed to be sold in Winter and P1 summer). - Amount of work and sales is constant throughout the year\n2.2. Location of Resources Resources:\n  Game Map Analogy - to real world :- (P: goods production, W: Amazon/Walmart Warehouse, S: shops or people to be delivered)    Two Plants P1 \u0026amp; P2 The plants produces both products. And production switches between the two products with out any delay Two warehouse W1 \u0026amp; W2 Store both products Amount of storage for each product refer section [2.4] Each vertical and horizontal distance is 1km in the grid  2.3. Sales The sales of the two products have the following constraints: - Shops are open 6 days a week - Number of shops = 20 - P1 \u0026gt;= 1 and P2 \u0026gt;= 1 for any given time of the year. - price of Pr1 = 300 euros and Pr2 = 100 euros Note : if customer does not find any one of the product then their is a penalty function. Comments : In order to generate more data we can assume that the monthly sales volume should be +/- 10% of the original sales volume for the same time period as given in sales.xls\n2.4. Storage Capacity We see the storage Capacity of both the items .\n   Product Warehouse 1 Warehouse 2     Product 1 650 650   Product 2 650 650    The above is weekly storage estimate based on total sales of all shops. i.e. capacity = argmax Sales(Pr1, Pr2) over 1 week. of all.\n Warehouse is expected to restock weekly. Shops restock on daily basis The storage capacity of all 20 shops are given.  Note : If demand of certain product is more than the capacity of a shop for that product, then we need more delivery from warehouse. Capacity cannot be expanded.\n2.5. Delivery Tour The deliveries are done by trucks, therefore the usual path taken is from factory - warehouse - shops.\n volume of heater (Pr 2): 0.4m^3 volume of a/c (Pr 1): 0.8m^3 capacity of trucks in volume: 20m^3 cost of delivery : 1 euro per kilometer  3. Solution 3.1. Production Model  In this we try to answer the question: \u0026ldquo;How many items must be produced each day by both the plants?\u0026ldquo; \n From the given problem statement it is seen that there are 20 shops with 2 plants that produces goods with 2 warehouses that stores them. \nThe main objective of the problem statement is to maximize the profit.\n  One method to view the problem in order to maximize the profit of this market:\n is to maximize the sales given the value of the products (300 and 100 euros) for the given market constraints and minimize the transportation cost in delivery of the goods to the shops from the warehouses.     market constraints : given is to satisfy the demand of the shops with the capacity constraints, which is the warehouse capacity.\n  The warehouse capacity is greater than sum of capacities of the shops.\n  The demand can be derived from the sales of each of the products.\n  [[Linear Optimization Model]] : Plant 1  Max 300 x[1] + 100 x[2] subject to, x[1] + x[2] ≤ 67600 (capacity) x[1] + x[2] ≥ 34305 (demand) x[i] ≥ 0 ∀ i ∈ {1,2}  Plant 2  Max 300 x[3] + 100 x[4] subject to, x[3] + x[4] ≤ 67600 (capacity) x[3] + x[4] ≥ 34305 (demand) x[i] ≥ 0 ∀ i ∈ {3,4}  x[i] represents amount of goods produced per year (a better formulation is needed will be done once I start working - again on this project)\nNOTE: such as products produced per week and further deduce it to per day.\n  The above two models represent where the plants satisfy the demands of shops closer to them.\n  We divide the market into two where the plant 1 satisfies demand of shops 1 -10 and plant to satisfies demand of shops 11 - 20.\n  The above two models represent where the plants satisfy the demands of shops closer to them. We divide the market into two where the plant 1 satisfies demand of shops 1 -10 and plant to satisfies demand of shops 11 - 20.\n  3.1.2. Dantzig Wolfe Decomposition method Well from the above two linear program it is evident that we can formulate the following problem as Dantzig Wolfe Decomposition method. This is also similar to [1] where the two plants are trying to satisfy the demands of the market (coupling constraint) and each plant has its own demands (subproblem) to be solved.\n3.1.3. Further Optimization: Integer or Linear Relaxtion Well both the problems need to be formulated as integer program or LP relaxation problem and then use Gomory cut algorithm to reduce it to integer solution. Note : we can also use branch and bound technique to get an integer solution.\n3.1.4. Slack \u0026amp; surplus Variable = Stored good in warehouse Introducing a surplus variable into the demand constraint and converting it to equality (standard LP form) will give us the amount of goods that needs be stored in the warehouse. \nExample: for Plant 2 is similar as Plant 1 as shown below\nPlant 1  Max 300 x[1] + 100 x[2] subject to, x[1] + x[2] + s[1] = 67600 (capacity) x[1] + x[2] - s[2] = 34305 (demand) x[i] ≥ 0 ∀ i ∈ {1,2} where s[1] = slack, s[2] = surplus  3.2. Transportation This problem has various approach to solve this problem. One such approach is to convert the problem into a variant of network flow problem.\n3.2.1 Graph theory formulation: We can formulate is as a bipartite graph such that, V = S U W, where S = {s1_v, \u0026hellip;. s20_v} and we replicated the same at W = {s1_w,\u0026hellip;..s20_w} we now connect the edges from s1_v to all the other vertices in partite set W except that we do not connect s1_v to s1_w since s1_v and s1_w are the same shop. Therefore d(s1_v) = 19, infact for each of the vertices in V and W.\nFuther we use backward substitution method to connect all the vertices in V to warehouses w1 and w2. Similarly we to the following for the partite set W. (Note the edges in this graph is assumed to have a cost which is the shortest distance between any two vertices)\nWe know that each of these vertices have a demand to be satisfied, when the demand for the vertices are met we say that the vertex is saturated. The conditions for Halls matching and Konig Egervary perfect matching theorem is met in such a graph. (Note : the above also seems more of assignment problem if # of trucks = 20)\nWe can use a variant of network flow and matching algorithm algorithm to solve the problem. We need to saturate the vertices which is basically the demand and also we define unit flow to be 20 m^3 in volume which is the capacity of each truck. We can determine to minimize the flow so that all of the vertices are saturated.\nConclusion: The above problem can be eaisly formulated as a combination of NP -hard and NP - complete problems i.e; variant of TSP, Bin Packing/ multi knapsack problem. Here I deduce this to a polynomial time problem.\n NOTE: Necessary Improvements\n  the model needs to be further improved as mentioned [[ Linear optimization model]] - [3.1] this will be done as I start working on this project again sooner\u0026hellip; transportation model needs to be formulated into LP [3.2.1] also create .md slides\u0026hellip;   Tools: I tried to work on Julia Optimization package and Julia light graphs.

Here we talk about the inception of Graph Theory, it\u0026rsquo;s application to the real world problems and a famous puzzle asked during my childhood. The blog also contain a pretty good talk given by a math student below in Chaos Computer Club congression.\nDuring the 18th century in the city of Königsberg the land masses were connected by seven bridges. The problem or challenge in the city was to walk or traverse through the seven bridges only once, i.e; to walk atmost only once on all the bridges. While the challenge was talk of the town during the period, we show on how Leonhard Euler approached the problem that actually gave rise to \u0026ldquo;Graph Theory\u0026rdquo;.\n  left to right city of Königsberg converted into graph (graph theory)   The right most part of the image shows on how the land masses and bridges are converted into graph theoretic notation. The land masses are represented by a circle or commonly called \u0026ldquo;Node or Vertex\u0026rdquo; and the line connecting two nodes is called an \u0026ldquo;Edge\u0026rdquo;. An edge commonly defines a relationship between two nodes and they always connect two nodes. The last term to know is degree of a node which is actually the number of edges or lines incident on a node or vertex. Now since we got the basics of Graph Theory before diving into Euler\u0026rsquo;s solution I would like share the childhood puzzle, well that\u0026rsquo;s why the whole blog started out to be.\nWhile in the 90\u0026rsquo;s and early 2000\u0026rsquo;s my city Bangalore or more infamously known as Garden City or Land of 1000 lakes was absolutely a great city \u0026amp; time to grow and have fun (name it from sport, education to being a cool kid you had it all). whoever you were one of the famous puzzle or challenge thrown at us was to draw the below image without lifting your pen or pencil and most importantly you cannot pass over the line already drawn i.e; you cannot pass a line twice.\n  figure to draw (familiar?)   While the above can be converted into graph theoretical notation, just as how Leonhard Euler did it. Well here is how, we can convert it by drawing circle or vertices or nodes at the four corners of the square and consider the line joining them as edges (curved lines are also edges). Now if you have tried solving the above you know that it is not possible to complete the following diagram, but almost possible well you may just miss one edge out of 10 (try). The explanation here is quite easy, I shall let you think with a hint \u0026ldquo;degree of vertex\u0026rdquo; well I hope that you paid attention to that term above to be more precise atleast two vertices or nodes or circles should have what number of degree\u0026rsquo;s (odd or even)? Hmmm!! Well did that just reveal the answer, hope not!!. But hey, just so you did not get the above story that\u0026rsquo;s absolutely fine see the video below to know more about Euler\u0026rsquo;s solution to Königsberg problem:\n    I hope you got it now, oh well there is always something about old white men and being genius got to blame Einstein. [😛] For more entertainment and want to know more about graph theory and video games as \u0026ldquo;we cool kids\u0026rdquo; love playing PC games. Here is a video from Chaos Computer Club\n The above video does have some very cool content if you are into topology, . The real world application of graph theory is quite immense due to its simplicity, it ranges from waking across the 18th century bridges to current navigation technology, yep that\u0026rsquo;s right google maps does use it. You can also use it for scheduling airplanes, project management, production management and hey what\u0026rsquo;s more important than scheduling your life ?\n update better links if exists on internet later Wiki - Seven Bridges Wiki - Topology\n","date":1554842921,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1554842921,"objectID":"5263c85ab21ec1ff998896893cf651c0","permalink":"/post/childhood-puzzle-solved/","publishdate":"2019-04-10T02:18:41+05:30","relpermalink":"/post/childhood-puzzle-solved/","section":"post","summary":"Whilst \u0026ldquo;Bridges\u0026rdquo; are built to span through obstacles, the preceding statement was quite erring in the city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) during the 18th century.
