      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is pretty cool talk by Charles Stross, given at &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Computer Club&lt;/strong&gt; congression this talk reflects my opinion or views on current world of corporates, startups, artificial intelligence (referred by speaker as corporate AI and computerized AI) and one ridiculed CEO or lets say more than one [:P]. You can also find reason&amp;rsquo;s on why I quit facebook or hated it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk starts by saying on how prediction 3 centuries back or even a century back was possible to do accurately. Which infact reminds me of what my astrologer threw at me when I asked him where I will exactly be in 5 years [ðŸ˜„]. Further the speaker talks about Artificial Intelligence singularity (computerized), infact you can giggle on when the speaker says @ 7:30 &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;if we created an AI equivalent of human mind it would be sitting on a couch and watching super bowl all day&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m sure to say this is one of the least obnoxious way anyone can put it knowing what we human&amp;rsquo;s are capable of doing or the way we live in 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To continue on the speaker says &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;AI as self optimizing tool which defy human comprehension&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, which is quite absolutely right, and while the comparison of airplane to seagull makes us want to giggle, we can also wonder if our education system &amp;amp; professor&amp;rsquo;s are doing good enough to produce skillful people or are we just about the grades ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;876&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; src=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/34c3-9270-dude_you_broke_the_future/oembed&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, continuing on the next statement that caught my attention when the speaker says &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;history is useful for so much more than that&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; funny on how forget our past in speaker&amp;rsquo;s words &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;our personal memory don&amp;rsquo;t span very long at all&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, haha! in fact, every 5 year&amp;rsquo;s we vote. [:D]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker further goes on to talk about paper clip maximizer theory of artificial intelligence and one of the CEO that supports it. Which to me seems funny on how people see things especially some the most renowned CEO&amp;rsquo;s. Just WOW!!! The speakers quirky comments are quite joyful and his correlation to corporations and governmental organization are so damn true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I can go on for quite a bit about this talk. I would like to keep the writing short and let you watch the video. This is more of an opinionated talk and is very entertaining. The speaker not so surprisingly also talks about the corporations like Facebook - its role in the society and developers building app&amp;rsquo;s that gets people addicted to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker Charles Stross quite greatly articulates my views and reasons why one should stay away from &lt;strong&gt;social media&lt;/strong&gt; and as well &lt;strong&gt;smart phone&lt;/strong&gt; as much as they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this video.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Childhood Puzzle Solved</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Bridges&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; are built to span through obstacles, the preceding statement was quite erring in the city of &lt;strong&gt;KÃ¶nigsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia)&lt;/strong&gt; during the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Here we talk about the inception of &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graph Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s application to the real world problems and a famous puzzle asked during my childhood. The blog also contain a pretty good talk given by a math student below in &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Computer Club&lt;/strong&gt; congression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 18th century in the city of KÃ¶nigsberg the land masses were connected by seven bridges. The problem or challenge in the city was to walk or traverse through the seven bridges only once, i.e; to walk &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;atmost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; only once on all the bridges. While the challenge was talk of the town during the period, we show on how &lt;strong&gt;Leonhard Euler&lt;/strong&gt; approached the problem that actually gave rise to &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Graph Theory&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    left to right city of KÃ¶nigsberg converted into graph (graph theory)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The right most part of the image shows on how the land masses and bridges are converted into graph theoretic notation. The land masses are represented by a circle or commonly called &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Node or Vertex&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and the line connecting two nodes is called an &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Edge&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. An edge commonly defines a relationship between &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; nodes and they always &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;connect two nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. The last term to know is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;degree&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; of a node which is actually the number of edges or lines incident on a node or vertex. Now since we got the basics of &lt;strong&gt;Graph Theory&lt;/strong&gt; before diving into Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution I would like share the childhood puzzle, well that&amp;rsquo;s why the whole blog started out to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;90&amp;rsquo;s and early 2000&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; my city &lt;strong&gt;Bangalore&lt;/strong&gt; or more infamously known as &lt;strong&gt;Garden City or Land of 1000 lakes&lt;/strong&gt; was absolutely a great city &amp;amp; time to grow and have fun (name it from sport, education to being a cool kid you had it all). whoever you were one of the famous puzzle or  &lt;strong&gt;challenge&lt;/strong&gt; thrown at us was &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;to draw the below image without lifting your pen or pencil and most importantly you cannot pass over the line already drawn i.e; you cannot pass a line twice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;






  



  
  











&lt;figure id=&#34;figure-figure-to-draw-familiar&#34;&gt;


  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;&#34; href=&#34;/post/childhood-puzzle-solved/flower_hu6431cdfcd78ca8e5e89ab626ae3a9e7f_11024_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; data-caption=&#34;figure to draw (familiar?)&#34;&gt;


  &lt;img data-src=&#34;/post/childhood-puzzle-solved/flower_hu6431cdfcd78ca8e5e89ab626ae3a9e7f_11024_2000x2000_fit_q90_lanczos.jpg&#34; class=&#34;lazyload&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;360&#34;&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;


  
  
  &lt;figcaption&gt;
    figure to draw (familiar?)
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;


&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the above can be &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;converted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; into graph theoretical notation, just as how &lt;strong&gt;Leonhard Euler&lt;/strong&gt; did it. Well here is how, we can convert it by drawing circle or vertices or nodes at the four corners of the square and consider the line joining them as edges (curved lines are also edges). Now if you have tried solving the above you know that it is not possible to complete the following diagram, but almost possible well you may just miss one edge out of 10 (try). The explanation here is quite easy, I shall let you think with a hint &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;degree of vertex&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; well I hope that you paid attention to that term above to be more precise atleast two vertices or nodes or circles should have what number of degree&amp;rsquo;s (odd or even)? &lt;strong&gt;Hmmm!! Well did that just reveal the answer, hope not!!&lt;/strong&gt;. But hey, just so you did not get the above story that&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fine see the video below to know more about Euler&amp;rsquo;s solution to KÃ¶nigsberg problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;    
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/W18FDEA1jRQ&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; allowfullscreen title=&#34;YouTube Video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you got it now, oh well there is always something about &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;old white men and being genius&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; got to blame Einstein. [ðŸ˜›] For more entertainment and want to know more about graph theory and video games as &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;we cool kids&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; love playing PC games. Here is a video from &lt;strong&gt;Chaos Computer Club&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width=&#34;768&#34; height=&#34;576&#34; src=&#34;https://media.ccc.de/v/SHA2017-319-mathematics_and_video_games/oembed&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
The above video does have some very cool content if you are into topology, .
&lt;p&gt;The real world application of graph theory is quite immense due to its simplicity, it ranges from waking across the 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century bridges to current navigation technology, yep that&amp;rsquo;s right google maps does use it. You can also use it for scheduling airplanes, project management, production management and hey what&amp;rsquo;s more important than scheduling your life ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt; update better links if exists on internet later&lt;/small&gt;
